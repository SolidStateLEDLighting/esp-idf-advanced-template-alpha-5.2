This is a sample boiler plate project for dual core Esp32 microcontroller running FreeRTOS.  This hardware is equivalent to a DevKit-C running an Esp32s3, but this project could be adapted
to another duel core processor.   If run on a single core processor, much of the included features would not be necessary (like varable locking between threads).

>More information about this project and all its components can be found in the docs directory.   Documentation is found on a project level and inside each component.
