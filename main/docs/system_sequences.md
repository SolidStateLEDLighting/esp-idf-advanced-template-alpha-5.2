# System Sequences
The creatation of the system object and the generalized process of creating subcomponents (with Tasks and without Tasks) is detailed at the project level [here](../../docs/project_sequences.md)

Sequencing is typically represented as a series of actions between two parties over time.  In the case of software, these parties are either objects or translations units or binary executable components.

In our specific case, we use sequences to represent actions between two or more objects.


## Creating Wifi Object
This is a very common pattern were an object with a run task is creating another object with its own run task.
