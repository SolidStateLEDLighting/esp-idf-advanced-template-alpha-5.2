# System Sequences
The creatation of the system object and the creating of subcomponents (with Tasks and without Tasks) is detailed at the project level [here](../../docs/project_sequences.md)

Sequencing is typically represented as a series of actions between two parties over time.  In the case of software, these parties are either objects or translations units or binary executable components.

In our case, we represent sequences as being coordinate action between two or more objects.
